Many code standards require line length always be under a prescribed limit to maintain readability. When using text editors like vi, emacs or nano it can be useful to have a margin indicating where this limit is. Tilix allows you to configure the limit on a per profile basis and then toggle the margin line on or off via a shortcut. The default shortcut is ctrl-alt-m.

This is available as of Tilix 1.8.1.
