Tilix 1.5.8 is now available with a number of new features and bug fixes.
 
One word of caution, this version of Tilix has changed to using PCRE2 for regular expressions when the VTE version indicates it is supported. Unfortunately Ubuntu 17.10 removed this functionality from VTE and hence Tilix is broken on 17.10 until Ubuntu patches Tilix in their distribution. See issue [#916](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/issues/916) for more information.

Other notable changes for this release include:

* Can detach sessions by dragging them off the sidebar to the desktop. Can re-attach sessions by dragging them from the sidebar to another tilix window
* Can re-order sessions via drag and drop in sidebar or by using ctrl-pgup or ctrl-pagedn
* If ctrl-c is assigned to copy shortcut, tilix is smart enough to only copy when text is selected otherwise normal interrupt is passed
* Window state is now restored on new launch, i.e. if window is maximized and closed it will be maximized when new instance is launched
* Added new variable for titles at session scope for active terminal title
* Added support for GTK active CSS style to enable better styling of terminal titlebars
* Added support for pending VTE hyperlink functionality (#904)
