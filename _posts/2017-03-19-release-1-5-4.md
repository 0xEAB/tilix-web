Tilix 1.5.4 has been released, this release is primarily about changing the name of the application from Terminix to Tilix. This is required because I received a notice of trademark infringement from the Terminix Corporation in the USA. 

This release does feature a number of bug fixes though including:

* Detaching terminal in Wayland by dropping it on desktop now works identically to X11
* Fixed issue with outdated LDC libraries on Fedora, this should allow COPR to work again
* Fixed issue with close dialog and long process names resulting in excessively wide dialog box
* Removed animation hint feature from quake mode as it was causing focus issues
* Fixed crash when loading multiple sessions from file

Note that when you update to Tilix, you will lose your settings due to the name change. To migrate your settings to Tilix, please perform the following steps:

```
dconf dump /com/gexperts/Terminix/ > terminix.dconf
dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < terminix.dconf
```
This will export your settings from the Terminix key in dconf and re-import them into the Tilix key.

Note that this will work even after you have uninstalled the tTerminix schema, since the user customized settings are available even after the schema got removed, and the default settings are identical between the two and thus do not matter.

Once you have imported the settings and everything is ok you can clear the old Terminix settings with:
```
dconf reset -f /com/gexperts/Terminix/
```
Finally to copy the bookmarks and custom themes just do:

mv ~/.config/terminix ~/.config/tilix
