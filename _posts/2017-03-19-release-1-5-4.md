Tilix 1.5.4 has been released, this release is primarily about changing the name of the application from Terminix to Tilix. This is required because I received a notice of trademark infringement from the Terminix Corporation in the USA. 

This release does feature a number of bug fixes though including:

* Detaching terminal in Wayland by dropping it on desktop now works identically to X11
* Fixed issue with outdated LDC libraries on Fedora, this should allow COPR to work again
* Fixed issue with close dialog and long process names resulting in excessively wide dialog box
* Removed animation hint feature from quake mode as it was causing focus issues
* Fixed crash when loading multiple sessions from file
