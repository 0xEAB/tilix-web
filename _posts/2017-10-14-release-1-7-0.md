Tilix 1.7.0 is now available with a few new features and bug fixes.
 
Notable changes for this release include:

* Added support for using tabs instead of the sidebar since it was requested so often
* Preliminary flatpak support now working thanks to the efforts of @jaje who did a phenomenal job on this, thanks!
* Fixed visual issues with DEs (looking at you MATE) that try to disable overlay scrolling with environment variables
* Added new variable for titles to return total number of sessions
* Added visual indicator when there is new content when scroll on new content is disabled
* Fixed a number of bugs and issues
